###My SkyBlock
- [Dragonland Skyblock](adragon.us.to) - Dragonland Skyblock, now 24/7! This server runs on Cuberite, so you get very high performance due to the nature of C++.

##Mod Loaders

- [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) - The biggest and most dominant mod loader by far. Supports the vast majority of mods, however, there are some disadvantages, mainly concerning stability and speed. *1.8*
- [LiteLoader](http://www.liteloader.com/) - The other biggest mod loader. LiteLoader does not provide APIs for modding the Minecraft engine, and thus is less capable than Forge, but is lighter, more stable (nearly never crashes), and updates faster. *1.8*
- [Meddle](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2488387-meddle-minecraft-tweakclass-mod-loader-1-9) - A plain LaunchWrapper and TweakClass mod loader. This one is the lightest, newest, and thus has stands out, because it is not version-dependent. Works on all versions starting with 1.6 (new launcher), however, mods must perform deobfuscation themselves. *Any Version*
- [ModLoader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272333-risugamis-mods-updated) - An old, dead, and deprecated loader for the old days. Mostly alive during the pre-1.6 days (before the new launcher). A little more hacked together due to class file use. *1.6.2*

##Modded Clients *(use at your own risk)*

- [Wurst](https://www.wurst-client.tk/) - A big and mature competitor in the world of modded clients, this one packs many hacks and client-side commands along with a nice management interface. Also supports additional mods. *1.8.8*
- [KiLO](https://kiloclient.com/) - A newer but high-quality modded client without hacks (fair play). This one specializes in the UI/UX and integration department. *1.8.8*
- [Wolfram](http://shadowspl0it.com/) - Another hacked client known as the "best client" for Minecraft which has a very good GUI, NoCheatPlus bypassing, and many hacks. *1.8.8*

##Resource Packs

- [oCd](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1233891-ocd-pack-by-disco-1-8) - A simple, 16x resource pack with very light and very basic textures. Looks more like pixel art from the 90s. *1.8.8*
- [Faithful](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8) - A double resolution texture pack that stays faithful to the original Minecraft textures. A 32x pack that remains consistent with very high quality, while keeping the vanilla textures' recognizability.

- [Minecraft Chat](https://github.com/rom1504/MinecraftChat) - A cool online, web-based chat client for Minecraft that lets you connect to regular servers and chat like any other player, from your browser.
- [Minecraft Console Client](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1263927-win-mac-linux-minecraft-console-client-1-8-3) - A chat-only lightweight Minecraft client in your console for those occasions where you don't want to start a whole, new, big, resource-hogging Minecraft, and just want to type some commands or chat. Includes chatbots and a chatlogger, and is written in C# (runs on .NET and Mono). *1.8.3*

##Server Software

- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) - Spigot is one of the only few CraftBukkit forks that have survived and still holds CraftBukkit code. This is the most used server software of all servers (including all popular servers listed here), which is nice after the DMCA takedown of Bukkit. *1.8, 1.9 [experimental]*
- [Torch](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/2564680-1-8-9-torch-project-a-multi-threaded-minecraft) - Project Torch, a open-source multi-threaded Minecraft server that supports "plugins" and includes the Torch API, as well as support (?) for Bukkit plugins. This needs a lot more love! *1.8*
- [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/) - The new and modern modding API for the server and client side. Sponge is a combination of a new API (based off of Spout/Flow’s APIs) implemented on top of Forge, with assistance from other parts of Minecraft’s modding community (Glowstone, Cauldron, Spout, etc.). *DEVELOPMENT 1.8*
- [SportBukkit](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/SportBukkit) - A direct fork of CraftBukkit updated for 1.8.7, with performance and aesthetic improvements. Also a project that contains Bukkit code. *1.8.7*
- [PyMineserver](https://github.com/Armored-Dragon/pymineserver) - The first fully functional Minecraft Modern server written in Python, using `quarry`. Supports 1.8.x and 1.7.5+ protocols. VERY WIP! *1.8.x, made by list author*
- [PaperSpigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/PAPER/repos/paperspigot/browse) - A fork of Spigot updated to 1.8.8 just like Spigot, with fixes for gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies and performance improvements. *1.8.8*
- [Glowstone++](http://glowstoneplusplus.github.io) - The successor and actively developed Glowstone fork that aims to feature everything the vanilla server has, and even more. Extremely close. This server supports the latest Bukkit 1.8.8 APIs and is 100% open-source and written from scratch. *1.8.8*
- [Cuberite/MCServer](http://cuberite.org/) - Another 100% open-source and written from scratch server replacement. Very fast, efficent, memory-friendly, and resource-friendly, as it is written in C++. Includes support for plugins in Lua, and features a great webadmin interface out-of-the-box. *1.8.x, 1.7.x*
