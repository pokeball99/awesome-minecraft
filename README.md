##Mods

- [Pixelmon](https://pixelmonmod.com/) - Pokémon, in Minecraft! Better than Pokémon in some ways, and overall a quality and stable mod. *1.8*

##Mod Loaders

- [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) - The biggest and most dominant mod loader by far. Supports the vast majority of mods, however, there are some disadvantages, mainly concerning stability and speed. *1.8*
- [LiteLoader](http://www.liteloader.com/) - The other biggest mod loader. LiteLoader does not provide APIs for modding the Minecraft engine, and thus is less capable than Forge, but is lighter, more stable (nearly never crashes), and updates faster. *1.8*
- [Meddle](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2488387-meddle-minecraft-tweakclass-mod-loader-1-9) - A plain LaunchWrapper and TweakClass mod loader. This one is the lightest, newest, and thus has stands out, because it is not version-dependent. Works on all versions starting with 1.6 (new launcher), however, mods must perform deobfuscation themselves. *Any Version*

##Modded Clients

- [Wurst](https://www.wurst-client.tk/) - A big and mature competitor in the world of modded clients, this one packs many hacks and client-side commands along with a nice management interface. Also supports additional mods. *1.8.8*

##Resource Packs

- [Lithos](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1244691-32x-lithos-default-style-detailed-1-8-1-9) - "Obviousness, Consistency, Beauty": very true. Lithos loads very quickly, is light on your system, and provides very consistent and recognizable textures. *1.9*
